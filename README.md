# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# referral
npx hardhat verify --network bsc 0xA021AcDe734F0b97eB0E1Ec67Be2d700d628b789 '0x0f3b3484297bBCC02591c89b7df966084CD9503A'
```
